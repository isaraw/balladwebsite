<h1>premise</h1>

<p>Before the disaster, more than 2000 people used to live in Erto (which means “hanging on” in Italian).<span style="color:#656b68"><b> [Read more]</b></span></p>

</div>

<div class="panel1"> Today it looks like a forgotten place with a dreamlike atmosphere where just 300 people live. But why does Erto look like a ghost town, despite having survived a catastrophe of these proportions? And who are the people still living there, still “hanging on” there?  <br/>
After the disaster, despite not facing any immediate danger, Erto is declared inhabitable by SADE. The owners of the dam think they can keep exploiting the reservoir. For economic reasons, Erto isn’t a village anymore, it is an obstacle. But the Authorities’ plan doesn’t go as forecasted. Once again, Erto hangs on: some of the inhabitants decide to go back ‘illegally’ to their old town immediately after the disaster. Walking at night through the forest to avoid the police checkpoints, they squat their own homes. The authorities cut off the electricity but they decide to stay in Erto in a decision taken in a famous Council meeting held on a filed. Only after decades, and thanks to the struggle of those who came back, Erto is declared legal again and recognized as a village. 50 years later, those who came back and their relatives are still there. This is their story.  <br/>
The film will follow their present challenge and unfolding events before and after the anniversary, based on the 4 seasons. As it is essential to give the audience an emotional feeling and information about the proportion of the disaster, archive material and personal video footage will be used.

<div class="title" onclick="slidetoggle2()" onmouseover="" style="cursor: pointer;" >

<h1> autumn</h1>

<p>Luciano thinks that the 50th anniversary in 2013 is the last chance to have a possible re-birth for Erto. <span style="color:#656b68"> <b>[Read more]</b></span></p></div>

<div class="panel2"> He thinks that the life of his village is not a destiny but a challenge and his dream is to restore all the derelict houses before they will collapse and repopulate Erto.  He’s about to meet two Mayors of two nearby towns to discuss what to do. He has a big goal: bringing to Erto one of the most famous Italian sporting event, the Cycling Race “Giro d’Italia”; this will put the spotlights on Erto, attracting all the media and lots of tourists. If it wasn’t enough, he wants Italy’s President walking in the streets of his village for the first time.   <br/>

But what he really dreams is to finally raise the money needed to rescue thevillage. For this, he has a controversial idea: exploiting again the water from the river, building a hydroelectric power station near the dam to produce electricity. This would create an income sufficient to rescue and restore the derelict houses and the streets in the old village; however, this idea obviously awakes vicious memories of the past and sharply divides the population of Erto. Luciano has an important ally: Mauro Corona, a bad -tempered  famous writer and carver based in Erto, with whom he’s discussing a strategic plan in the local Osteria.   <br/>

On the contrary, Giovanna can’t stand the whole fuss about the anniversary of the disaster. For her the dam is a “sacred” place: she lost 13 relatives in the Vajont tragedy. Her anger is addressed not only to those responsible for the disaster but also to those fellow-citizens who would like to exploit the tragedy for touristic purposes. She struggle to come to terms with the anger she has inside. She just loves grazing her goats as she thinks “they are better than human being, because they really love you”.   <br/>

The 9th of October is approaching. Cristiano and his friend Elia take the bus bringing them to the nearest school, one hour drive from Erto. At school, the teacher makes the lesson on the history of the Vajont tragedy. Meanwhile, Luciano and other villagers are organizing the torchlight walk towards the dam. On that night, some of the inhabitants will attend the event walking up to the dam. Giovanna, instead, will be on her own, as she does every year: on that evening, she goes by herself down to the river: there, she lights some candles and leaves  them there, for the whole night.  In the silence, she stays there, with her endless grief, praying on her own.  
</div>

<div class="title" onclick="slidetoggle3()" onmouseover="" style="cursor: pointer;" >

<h1> winter is arriving</h1>

<p>Erto is completely white, submersed by the snow.  <span style="color:#656b68"> <b>[Read more]</b></span></p></div>

<div class="panel3">Peppino overlooks the village from his big house on the mountain facing Erto, where he had to move to after that fateful night of 9th October 1963.  He’s at home, watching TV and talking to the TV, his only companion. Giovanna walks in the snow, as she does every day in wintertime, going to feed her goats. Meanwhile, Cristiano, has to face his own hurdles.  Because of the isolation of Erto and the lack of music schools nearby, he run the risk to give up his dream of enhancing his musical skills.   <br/>

Luciano’s big plan is developing. He is about to meet several authorities but also his fellow citizens sceptical about any attempt to re-use the water of the river for economic purpose. He goes door by door to meet his fellow citizens, explaining to them the idea.   <br/>

In the local Osteria, villagers talk about the past of Erto, remembering how they came back to Erto illegally, about the famous Council meeting held on a field and how their struggle has been able to keep Erto still “existing”.  Sometimes Cristiano, along with his friend Elia, goes to the local ‘Osteria’ with his accordion. There, he silently witnesses the discussions about the 50th anniversary between the villagers and the Mayor.  Cristiano also knows that, Giovanna, his grandmother is against any possible celebration. 
</div>

<div class="title" onclick="slidetoggle4()" onmouseover="" style="cursor: pointer;" >

<h1>spring</h1>

<p>Luciano is organising a public consultation with the citizens and the survivors of the tragedy in order to trying to gain their support. <span style="color:#656b68"> <b>[Read more]</b></span></p></div>

<div class="panel4">They are about to discuss the hydroelectric power station project. Lots of emotions and memories rise in the villagers’ heads and Erto seems to be divided. He’s quite nervous as he’s conscious on how deep and open the memory of the tragedy still is. 
In the meantime, the pageant Via Crucis is approaching. While the village takes part of this entertaining and recurring event, the two kids, Cristiano and Elia start to climb trees again, playing around. They hang out together all the time spending their free time in the forest. Cristiano is trying to teach how to play accordion to Elia.   <br/>

Another house in the old village had to be pulled down for safety reason. Luciano stands in front of it. He thinks that the houses are like them, hanging on, trying not to disappear. But not only are the houses vanishing in Erto. The old inhabitants, those who came back 50 years ago are disappearing too, dying, or getting lost into their mind: Peppino, who has lived all his life on his own, is now getting worse, more and more disconnected from reality . <br/> From his window, he overlooks the village. There’s a possibility that he will have to be moved into a care home, far away from his beloved Erto.  All these events are witnessed through Cristiano’s eyes. His look at his world will be reflected with evocative images, and his voice and naïve questions punctuate some of the key moments of the film.  
</div>

<div class="title" onclick="slidetoggle5()" onmouseover="" style="cursor: pointer;" >

<h1>final part of the film</h1>

<p>The inhabitants of Erto have mix feelings about the arrival of the tourists. <span style="color:#656b68"><b> [Read more]</b></span></p></div>
<div class="panel5">And the biggest event ever happened in Erto is about to approach: the arrival of the Cycling Tour Giro d’Italia. On the eve of the arrival, the whole village is hyper, split between huge expectations and the raising rage: Erto is flooded by televisions, journalists, and tourists. For few days, the village will be completely different.    <br/>

The torchlight walk is on again. But hopefully, this time, the Italian President will walk along the village and meet the villagers. The dramaturgical arch of the film ends beyond the 9th October: what will the future for Erto hold after the big celebration?  <br/>

In Autumn, Luciano holds a final public consultation with the inhabitants of Erto and the survivors of the tragedy, trying to face the anger of those who are against his plan. He’s very nervous; he knows that his proposal is touching a deep, open scar: will the proposal of exploiting the water again after 50 years will be accepted? Will there be a cost and what impact will it have on our main characters and on the wider community?  <br/>

Will Luciano succeed in having for the first time the President of the Italian Republic walking in the ghostly town of Erto? Moreover, putting the spotlight on the village will be enough? Will the inhabitants pull off a harmonious and glorious regenerating event or, will the fast-paced, real life see their aspirations evaporate and Erto will be forgotten again?
